Stainless steel is widely employed in a variety of industries, including aerospace, chemical processing, and transportation.Activated TIG (A-TIG) dramatically enhances weld penetration up to 1.5- 4 times in a single pass. A-TIG is the centre of investigation among researchers because of its deep penetrating capacity.
